Note: a working website *has* been created, but is not included currently in the repository

## ABOUT

Stroke-Prediction is an advanced software that asks you questions, and makes a prediction of your risk of stroke using neural network capabilities. It includes the following:

- 99.78% accuracy, when tested 14000 times
- 16 different inputs
- Multilayered Neural Network
- Works with Windows, MacOS, and Linux
- Extremely lightweight
- Simplistic, easy-to-use UI

Please be aware that this is **not** a diagnosis, only a recommendation to go see a doctor. Please take all results with a grain of salt.

## USE

Either:
- Install STROKE-PREDICTION-V1.0.0.zip, unzip it, and run it (REMOVED DUE TO LARGE FILE SIZE)
- Download stroke-prediction folder, and run user.py in external python compiler. Make sure you have all python module dependancies
